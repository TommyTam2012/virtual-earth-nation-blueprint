```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
Get-FileHash .\<filename.pdf> -Algorithm SHA256
```

Compare the output with the hashes listed above.

## OpenTimestamps Proofs

Each section's PDF should also have a `.ots` file ‚Äî a blockchain timestamp proof.  
To verify an OTS proof:

```bash
ots verify <filename.pdf.ots>
```

If you don't have `opentimestamps-client` installed, you can verify using the web at [https://opentimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org).
