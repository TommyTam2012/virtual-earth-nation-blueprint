### **Section 1 — Overview**
- **File:** [Virtual_Earth_Nation_Section1_Overview_v1_1.pdf](Virtual_Earth_Nation_Section1_Overview_v1_1.pdf)
- **SHA-256:** `95d631c8703e37a93b8b8fe2ca41fed8b549b64db26da88f56bdfe8939164da5`
- **Summary:** Introduces the Virtual Earth Nation concept, its vision, governance principles, and how it differs from existing virtual land platforms (e.g., Earth2.io). Sets the foundation for a fully-regulated virtual society with real-world goods & services integration.

### **Section 2 — Economy & Currency Framework**
- **File:** [Virtual_Earth_Nation_Section2_Economy_Currency.pdf](Virtual_Earth_Nation_Section2_Economy_Currency.pdf)
- **SHA-256:** `6b55ec5a7c1f5ae51683b541ab469d063216409f3863088698285c1e0762f6f6`
- **Summary:** Details the economic philosophy, currency structure, and AI-driven stability mechanisms. Defines the Real Money → VEX → VC flow, anti-hoarding rules (2% VC decay after 6 months inactivity), and inflation control systems.

**Glossary:**  
- **WT** = Work Tokens (labor receipts).  
- **WT-E** = Environmental Work Tokens.  
- **Conversion path:** **WT/WT-E → VEX → VC** (then optional fiat/stablecoin off-ramp).  
- All legacy references to “EC” in earlier drafts refer to the VEX/VC exchange layer.

### **Section 3 — Governance & Law**
- *(Published — file link & hash to be inserted once finalized)*

### **Section 4 — Real Estate & Infrastructure**

- **Summary:** AI + digital twins for site selection, simulation, financing, build, and ongoing maintenance; tokenized human labor tied to real-world value.  
- **Note:** Diagram temporarily removed for stability; currency naming unified to WT → VEX → VC.

### **Section 5 — Commerce & Services Ecosystem**

- **Summary:** Human-in-the-loop services (retail, hospitality, education, logistics, etc.) with AI routing/QA, escrowed contracts, reputation, and WT→VEX→VC conversion.  
- **Note:** Currency naming unified to WT → VEX → VC.

### **Section 6 — Environmental & Resource Impact**
- **File:** [Virtual_Earth_Nation_Section6_Environmental_Resource_Impact_v1_3_textfix.pdf](Virtual_Earth_Nation_Section6_Environmental_Resource_Impact_v1_3_textfix.pdf)
- **SHA-256:** `3af6fab7f4cafd8df96a0647d369bde1ab4468dbcdfa19a691b69b79aff27c50`
- **Summary:** Digital-twin monitoring, resource markets (carbon, water, materials, biodiversity), and WT-E jobs (cleanups, retrofits, habitat builds). KPIs include tCO2e avoided, water saved, circularity, biodiversity, and equity metrics. Funding via municipal/ESG contracts; on-chain verification and audits.  
- **Note:** Currency naming unified to WT-E → VEX → VC; KPI clarifies tCO2e.

### Section 7 — Mobility & Logistics

- **SHA-256:** cb61688974d780cc9ea6608562c091bf0503bcd843e294b87de5e7703776f582
- **Summary:** Digital-twin design, AI dispatch with human-in-the-loop ops, and WT -> VEX -> VC pay flow. Tracks tCO2e per passenger-km/ton-km, enforces safety, equity, and governance alignment with Sections 2–6.

### Appendix A — Zero-Carbon Mobility Mandate
- **File:** Virtual_Earth_Nation_Appendix_A_Zero_Carbon_Mobility_Mandate_v1_0_textfix.pdf
- **SHA-256:** a550b9741fcc9c56cbae72efe53e6cfeb90a63c0cea4b5eda667e4d21f4acfce
